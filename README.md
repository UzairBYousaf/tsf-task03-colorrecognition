# tsf-task03-colorrecognition

This was my third task as a Computer Vision & IoT intern at The Sparks Foundation, in this task I had to implement a color recognition system which could identify any color in a given image. I did this simply by OpenCV by retrieving the R,G & B values from the pixel and matching them to a color dataframe given in the Colors.csv file. It was a relatively simply task.
